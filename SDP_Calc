2. Output (math expressions)
---------------
Total capital needed = (Purchase price + closing cost + holding cost + rehab budget)
max $ that can be financed = (total capital - (closing cost + holding cost)) * Max % of Cost to be financed
actual to be finaced = (max $ that can be financed)
closing holding cost/interest added to loan = closing cost + holding cost 
total loan amnt = (max $ that can be financed) + closing holding cost/interest added to loan
Cash Required (over life of project) = Total capital needed - (closing cost + holding cost + max $ that can be financed)
total all in cost = Total capital needed + Interest AMT
% of arv = (total all in cost/ARV)


agent cost = projected resale * projected cost of sale (%)
projected profit = projected resale - agent cost - total all in cost.
roi = projected profit \ total all in cost * 100
anualized roi =
